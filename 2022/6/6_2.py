Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for messages.

A start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.

Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above examples:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb: first marker after character 19
bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 23
nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 23
nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 29
zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 26
How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?
